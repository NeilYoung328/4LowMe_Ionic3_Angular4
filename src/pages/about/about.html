        <h4> About 4Lowme</h4>
        <p>
          looking for a way for a group of people or just a couple of people to not only share their  <br/>
            location but also track their every move within a select period (session)? Well with 4LowMe, you are able to send request for your friends and family to follow you to any destination. Security being important, you will be able to turn off your location when that time comes for you to fall off the grid.
          A social media platform, you can track a race with friends as seen in movies, with all members of the race seen on your map as they navigate through tracks.
          Mom can also use this as a way to see where the rest of the family is in a busy area such as the mall, keep track of where each member has been. Great way to facilitate social event in general.
          Please feel free and let us know what we can do to make this even better, as we continue to make this fit your needs.
          Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
